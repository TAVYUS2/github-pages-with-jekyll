title: "First thing in the morning"

Before the kids wake up I'm already downstairs tapping on the 
keyboard. Using a typing program to get familiar with the 
keyboard and become faster. It has been a month since I 
started this journey. My <code> html </code> is decent but I 
still need to understand aria roles. CSS is a struggle and Javascript 
is straight up scary. My younger brother, Jawann, is soing his best to 
guide me. However this is a solo journey. Being self taught definitely
not easy.
